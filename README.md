Mini-Project 1: Adaptive Cruise Control in CARLA
=================================================

## Overview

In this homework, we will design an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. An ego car (host car) equipped with ACC typically has a sensor, such as radar, that estimates the distance to the vehicle in front (lead car) of the same lane.

The basic operation of ACC is as follows: the driver sets a desired cruise speed `desired_speed` that is assumed to be constant across this project. If the distance between the host car and the lead car is greater than the safe distance `distance_threshold`, then the host car attempts to travel at the desired cruise speed. If the distance between the host car and the lead car is less than the safe distance, then the host car tries to maintain at least a safe distance from the lead car.

The inputs to the ACC are the desired cruise speed for the host car, the estimated distance between the lead car and the host car, and the host car's velocity. The output of the ACC-based controller is the acceleration value for the host car.

## Task

You are given a project with the structure:
```
csci513-miniproject1/
├── Carla.def
├── Carla.Dockerfile
├── HPC-Instructions.md
├── Makefile
├── mp1_controller
│   ├── controller.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── mp1_evaluation
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── __main__.py
├── mp1_simulator
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── misc.py
│   ├── render.py
│   └── simulator.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── setup.cfg
└── setup.py
```

To get started, we are providing a skeleton of a closed loop system in this package.
The files in `mp1_simulator` interfaces with CARLA to simulate the ego and lead cars.
The primary control logic for the ego car is contained within the `mp1_controller` directory.

To assist in your control design, the `controller.py` contains a template of a controller. Your task is to edit the `Controller` class in `controller.py` such that the `run_step` function takes in an `Observation` (consisting of the desired cruise speed for the host car, estimated distance between the lead car and the host car, and the host car's velocity), and outputs an acceleration value between `-10.0` and `10.0` (in unit-less control inputs). The acceleration control input is internally used to set the throttle and brakes for the ego vehicle.


## Setup

There are two ways to setup the project. The first method uses direct system installation, and the second method uses Docker. Both of these methods require a GPU. If you dont have access to a GPU, refer to HPC instructions (HPC-Instructions.md) to use HPC for working on the project.

For local installations, follow the instructions below:

These instructions assume you have some Linux device. If you are using Windows, check out [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-cuda-in-wsl).


In all instances, you need to have the following prerequisite packages installed:

1. Python >= 3.8
2. GNU Make


### The direct way

You will need to install CARLA (version 0.9.15). Follow the [instructions](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/start_quickstart/) in the linked page for your specific platform.
You will also need its [additional assets](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/start_quickstart/#import-additional-assets).

*IMPORTANT:* Remember to verify that you are installing version 0.9.15


### The Docker way

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Install [`nvidia-docker2`][nvidia-docker2] container runtime to allow `docker` to use GPUs during execution.
3. Install GNU Make
4. Run `make build` to build the Docker image.

  *NOTE:* Docker requires root privileges, so keep an eye out for the `sudo` prompt.

[nvidia-docker2]: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installation-guide

### Common for both of the above

From the current project directory, run

```shell
$ pip install -e .
```
This command will install the project dependencies, and allow you to run the simulations easily. If this command fails with an error similar to `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement carla==0.9.15 (from versions: 0.9.5)` you must first update pip with `pip install --upgrade pip` or `conda update pip`

## Running the simulations.

To run the simulations, you will need to have 2 terminals opened.

1. In the first terminal window, start the Carla server:
  - *Direct way:*
	- Change directory to the CARLA root folder
    
  - *Docker way:*
	- simply run `make run-carla`.
	- Run
    
```shell
$ ./CarlaUE4.sh -RenderOffScreen
```

2. In the other terminal, go to the project root folder to start the controller:
```shell
$ python3 -m mp1_simulator --n-episodes 10
```

You can also run the following to see what options you have for the controller.
```shell
$ python3 -m mp1_simulator --help
```

When you run the script, it will save a CSV file in the `logs/` directory for every episode.
These CSV files (or _traces_) are a recording of the simulation consisting of only the state variables we deem necessary for evaluating your design.

## Evaluating your design

In this assignment, we will use Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirements to ensure the
correctness of the controller. To do this, we use the [RT-AMT][rtamt] package (installed
automatically) to define offline monitors for your controller.

[rtamt]: https://github.com/nickovic/

To evaluate the traces you've captured for your controller, simply run the following
command:
```shell
$ python3 -m mp1_evaluation <list of log files>
```
where `<list of log files>` is a placeholder for all the CSV files you need to evaluate.
An example (assuming you are saving the files in `logs/` directory) would be:
```shell
$ python3 -m mp1_evaluation logs/*
```
which will evaluate all the files in that directory.
